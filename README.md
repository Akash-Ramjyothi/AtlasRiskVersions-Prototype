## Description:
Developed a Dashboard prototype to Fetch the latest versions of AtlasRisk along with the respective Region and Environment. It allows the user to check the Module's TYPE, PROCESSINSTANCE and LATEST_RUN. The Dashboard will fetch the region wise build and release version. This project is designed to help the environment team and QA team to find which versions are deployed before triggering the regression.

## Note: Currently only consists of sample-data. Yet to be integrated to the backend.
